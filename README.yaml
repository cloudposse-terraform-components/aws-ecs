  Here's an example snippet for how to use this component.

  The following will create

  - ecs cluster
  - load balancer with an ACM cert placed on example.com
  - r53 record on all \*.example.com which will point to the load balancer

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      ecs:
        settings:
          spacelift:
            workspace_enabled: true
        vars:
          name: ecs
          enabled: true
          acm_certificate_domain: example.com
          route53_record_name: "*"
          # Create records will be created in each zone
          zone_names:
            - example.com
          capacity_providers_fargate: true
          capacity_providers_fargate_spot: true
          capacity_providers_ec2:
            default:
              instance_type: t3.medium
              max_size: 2

          alb_configuration:
            public:
              internal_enabled: false
              # resolves to *.public-platform.<environment>.<stage>.<tenant>.<domain>.<tld>
              route53_record_name: "*.public-platform"
              additional_certs:
                - "my-vanity-domain.com"
            private:
              internal_enabled: true
              route53_record_name: "*.private-platform"
              additional_certs:
                - "my-vanity-domain.com"
  ```
